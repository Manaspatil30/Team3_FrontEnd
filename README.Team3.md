# Brief description
The frontend was set up through the JavaScript framework React. React provides developers with a preset structure for the project, including folders for components, pages, and styles. Once the components were created, they were imported and exported to various pages or even other components themselves. The frontend team (Manas, Uzair and Oghuzan) could then structure the layout of the various pages and apply CSS styling where appropriate. The main hub of the project would be located in the App.js file, where routes for each page were defined and components such as the Navigation Bar and Footer were mounted to the top and bottom of the page respectively. The backend team (Max, Will, Abdul) also had access and could request to make changes where appropriate.

# Prerequisites
